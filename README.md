# Steph-s-Workout-Tracker

In this assignment, I created a workout tracker that allows a user to create new cardio and weight-lifting workouts, that are saved to a Mongo database. The application runs thrpugh Heroku, using Mongo DB. Some difficulties I had when creating this program were being able to have workouts show up on the time graph on the dashboard. Below is a screenshot of the program and relevant links.
